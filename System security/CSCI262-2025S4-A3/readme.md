README - CSCI262 Assignment 3
---------------------------------

This program implements an Email System Event Modeler & Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in accordance to the defined system requirements.

---

## 1. Requirements

- **Python** installed on your system
- **Required files** in the same directory:
  - `IDS.py`
  - `Events.txt`
  - `Stats.txt`

---

## 2. Running the Program

### A) Command Line Mode

**Usage:**
python IDS.py Events.txt Stats.txt <days>

**Example:**
    python IDS.py Events.txt Stats.txt 30


**This executes:**
1. Initial Input phase
2. Activity Engine (baseline log generation)
3. Analysis Engine (baseline statistics computation)
4. Alert Engine (interactive menu for anomaly detection)


### B) Interactive Mode

**Usage:**
python IDS.py


The program will prompt you for:
- `Events.txt` file path
- `Stats.txt` file path
- Number of days to generate

---

## 3. Files Generated by the Program

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `event_logs.csv` | Raw event logs with timestamps |
| `baseline_stats.csv` | Baseline mean and standard deviation for each event |
| `daily_totals.csv` | Summary totals per event, per day |

---

## 4. Alert Engine: How to Use It

After baseline generation, the program automatically enters **ALERT MODE**.

**To test anomaly detection:**

1. Prepare a new statistics file (e.g., `NewStats1.txt`)
2. Choose option: **"Load new statistics and detect anomalies"**
3. Enter the number of days for simulation
4. Review the anomaly report (each day will be marked as **"FLAGGED"** or **"okay"**)

### New Stats File Format

New stats files **must** follow the `Stats.txt` format:

**Example:**
```
5
Logins:1:1:
Time online:50:10:
Emails sent:2:1:
Emails opened:4:2:
Emails deleted:1:1:
```

---

## 5. Notes

- **CSV format** is used for logs because it is human-readable and convenient to parse.
- **Baseline statistics** are computed once and **NOT** overwritten during alert detection.
- **New statistics files** should be `.txt` files following the same format as `Stats.txt`.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### If Python cannot find `IDS.py`:

Make sure you are in the correct directory: `cd <folder path>`

### If "file not found" error appears:

Ensure `Events.txt`, `Stats.txt`, and any new stats files are in the same directory as `IDS.py`.
